# BasicNavigation

These are the only extra libraries I needed to install to keep it simple.
Then just put all the files in your root folder of your project. The only file 
that will be replaced is 'App.js'. Everything else just lives in the project next to 
'App.js' and all of the other stuff that gets created when you make a new project.

Create the app:
expo init myApp

Install Navigation Libraries:
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
@react-native-community/masked-view
