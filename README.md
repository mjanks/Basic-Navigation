These are the initial libraries I installed.
Then just put all the files in your root folder of your project. The only file 
that will be replaced is 'App.js'. Everything else just lives in the project next to 
'App.js' and all of the other stuff that gets created when you make a new project.

Create the app: 
expo init myApp

Install Navigation Libraries: 
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
